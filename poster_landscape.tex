%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   We compare several high-order methods for solving the radial Schr\"odinger
   and Dirac equations, in particular, spectral finite element method, $p$-FEM,
   $h$-FEM, and $hp$-FEM. All methods provide a robust way of calculating all
   eigenstates to machine precision. They differ in the rate of convergence and
   whether a good initial mesh is needed or not, as well as providing robust
   error control.

  \headerbox{Motivation}{name=motivation,column=0,below=contribution}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The need for an efficient solution to the radial Dirac equation arises
in the calculation of the \textbf{equation of state and opacity of materials
under extreme conditions}.

These calculations often rely on
self-consistent average-atom codes to compute the atomic structure for a
representative atom in a plasma. For plasmas at low densities and high
temperatures, a very large number of Rydberg states are accessible,
often requiring the calculation of principal quantum numbers of 100 or
higher.

This poses a challenge for the existing average-atom models, since they have
difficultly in \textbf{resolving all the bound states} just below the
continuum, and accurately computing the wave-function of
high-principal-quantum-number states near the nucleus.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\small
Finite element (FE) methods\cite{solin} partition the problem domain into
subdomains called "elements", and represent the desired solution as a linear
combination of piecewise polynomials defined within each element; wherein $h$
characterizes the element size and $p$, the polynomial order.
\begin{itemize}
\item $h$-FEM increases accuracy by decreasing $h$
\item $p$-FEM increases accuracy by increasing $p$
\item $hp$-FEM increases accuracy by refining both $h$ and $p$ simultaneously
\end{itemize}
Polynomial and strictly local basis $\to$ robust and naturally parallel
method for solution of large-scale PDE problems, as in electronic
structure\cite{pask}.

%Plane waves (PW) are pseudospectral method, on the same level as spectral
%element method (uniform-$p$-FEM), which is a subset of $p$-FEM, which is a
%subset of $hp$-FEM.

$hp$-FEM has many favorable properties: exponential convergence, automatic
adaptivity (no a priori knowledge needed), any geometry and boundary
conditions, and systematic error control.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\headerbox{Schr\"odinger Equation}{name=schroed,column=1}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Radial Schr\"odinger equation:
$$(-\half \rho^2 R')' + (\rho^2 V + \half l(l+1)) R = \epsilon \rho^2 R$$
Weak formulation:
$$
\int \half \rho^2 R'v' + (\rho^2 V + \half l(l+1)) Rv \d\rho
        -\half[\rho^2R'v]_0^a =
$$
$$
= \epsilon \int \rho^2 Rv \d\rho
$$
Discretization in an FE basis produces a generalized eigenvalue problem
of the form $A x = \lambda B x$.

Setting boundary term $\half[\rho^2R'(\rho)v(\rho)]_0^a=0$ imposes $R'(a)=0$
but no restriction on $R$ at $\rho=0$, due to vanishing of $\rho^2$. We impose
$R(a)=0$ by restricting the FE basis and allow the natural BC at $\rho=0$: we
solve for $R(0)$ directly (note that in general $R(0)\neq 0$).
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \headerbox{Dirac Equation}{name=dirac,column=1,below=schroed,row=0}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Radial Dirac equations:
$$
-\hbar c \left({\d\over\d\rho} - {\kappa\over\rho}\right)Q + (V+mc^2-W)P=0
$$
$$
+\hbar c \left({\d\over\d\rho} + {\kappa\over\rho}\right)P + (V-mc^2-W)Q=0
$$
Weak formulation:
$$
\int PVv_1 \d\rho -\hbar c Q'v_1 + \hbar c{\kappa\over\rho}Qv_1 \d\rho =
\epsilon \int Pv_1 \d\rho
$$
$$
\int \hbar c P'v_2 + \hbar c{\kappa\over\rho}Pv_2 + (V -2mc^2)Qv_2 \d\rho =
\epsilon \int Q v_2 \d\rho
$$
Correspondence between the radial Schr\"odinger and Dirac equation is:
$$
\rho^2 R^2(\rho) = P^2(\rho) + Q^2(\rho)
$$

\begin{itemize}
\item High-order adaptive FE methods provide a \textbf{robust,
variational alternative} to
conventional shooting methods, finding all desired states simultaneously, with
accuracy and orthogonality approaching machine precision.
\item High-order $p$-FEM and $hp$-FEM are \textbf{superior to $h$-FEM in atomic structure context}.
\item $hp$-FEM is the method of choice when little or no a priori information is
available; however, in atomic-structure context, much is known --> high-order
$p$-FEM can be superior in practice (due to practical constraints on $hp$-FEM
mesh --- further research is needed).
\item Future: extend present Schr\"odinger formulations to Dirac equation and
self-consistent calculations.
